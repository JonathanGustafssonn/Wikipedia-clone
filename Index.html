      <p>The World Wide Web often abbreviated as WWW or just called the Web is a collaboration medium made for sharing information with other people over the internet.The Web is the only way to access information through the Internet. The web is a system of internet servers that support specially formatted documents. Documents used in the WWW are formatted in a markup language called HyperText Markup Language but more oftenly abrreviated as HTML. HTML supports features used throughout the web such as links. Internet documents are interlinked using hypertext links and are accessible via the WWW through a web browser</p>

            <p>Widely speaking British scientist Tim Berners-Lee is recognized as the father and creator of the world wide web. Berners-Lee invented the Web in 1989 while working at CERN. The web was originally intended to be used to meet demand for automated information sharing between scientists at CERN. Which was prominent since CERN scientists worked at different universities and institutes around the world. The first proposal for the web was brough in by Tim in march 1989, when that proposition was ignored his second was brought in during may 1990. But despite his attempts it was first when he started working together with Belgian systems engineer Robert Cailliau and they presented the web as a managment proposal in Novemer 1990 that the web was set to begin development. </p>

          <p> .</p>
          <div class="WriteBox">
            <p>The proposal outlined the principal concepts and defined crucial terms behind the web. The document described a "HyperText Project" which was called "World Wide Web" in which a web of hypertext documents could be viewed through browsers.</p>

          <div class="WriteBox">
              <p>In the end of 1990, Tim Berners-Lee had the first server for the World wide web running at CERN. The server was in place for him to be able to demonstrate his ideas. The code for the web server was developed on a NeXT computer. To prevent the server from being switched off the computer had a hand-written label stating the fact that the computer in fact was a server.</p>

          <h3>The Web Extends</h3>
          <div class="WriteBox">
              <p>The first verson of the web was severly limited in terms of users, since it only worked on NeXT. Becuase of this development started on a simpler "line-mode" browser which could run on any system. The browser was written by the studen Nicola Pellow during her work placement at CERN. In 1991 the first version of the WWW software which included the line-mode browser was released. This version of the web also included a web server software and a library for developers. In March of the same year the web was made accessible to people using CERN computers. Later in august the web gained a lot of traction on different internet NewsGroups after Tim-Berners-Lee had informed them of the webs existence, this contributed to a wide spread of interest for the project all over the globe.</p>

          <p>Going Global</p>
          <div class="WriteBox">
              <p>In December of 1991 Paul Kunz and Louise Addis with their combined efforts launched the first web server in the United states, it was launched in the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC) in California. At this time there were two browsers which operated the web. The original development version which was only useable on NeXT machine and the line-mode browser, which was useable on all systems but had a non userfriendly interface. It became clear to the team at CERN wouldn't be able to continue development of the software on their own. Therefore a plea was launched asking other developers to join in one development of the project. This resulted in a lot of developers writting browsers mostly targeted at the X-Window System. Notable among these were Midas by Tony Johnson, Viola by Pei Wei and Erwise by Finnish students from Helsinki University of Technology. </p>

          <div class="WriteBox">
              <p>Early in the year of 1993 the National Center for SuperComputing Application (NCSA) at the University of Illinois released a first version of their Mosaic browser. This browser was run in the X Window System evironment which was popular in the research community since it offered fridnly window-based interaction. Shortly after (NCSA) released versions of their browser for bot the PC and also the Macintosh environments.
              The existence of these relaible user-friendly browsers on these popular computers led to an immense increase in the spread of the WWW. From here the Webs growth only continued with the european commission approving their first web project called (WISE) at the end of 1993. in April the same year CERN made the source code for the web royalty free contributing to an increased growth of interest and availability to the system. This had huge impact on the growth of the web showed by the fact that the web hosted 10 000 servers and 10 million users by the end of 1993</p>
